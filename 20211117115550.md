Good afternoon fellow engineers.  I like pretty pictures and used to use Visio
all the time to make diagrams.  I since discovered diagrams.net (used to be
called draw.io), and have been using it to create 1-page cluster summaries for
proposals.  I think it beats taking screenshots of sizer and piecing a cluster
summary together in powerpoint, both for ease of use as well as the end result.
Here's a sample of what I've got now:

<insert PNG>

It's still a work in progress, and I would love any input, good or bad.

Here is a link to a sample file with two variations, one small brand-new
cluster, and one to show a cluster expansion:

I admit it can be a little tedious to adjust all the details, so your mileage
may vary, but once you get the hang of the tool and the elements it's not that
bad.

I insert these into Powerpoint as PNGs (File -> Export as -> PNG...), and I also
change the default to use a transparent background.

PS, let me know if you have any problems accessing the file...I think that's the
easiest way to share it.
